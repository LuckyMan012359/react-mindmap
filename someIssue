I developed mind map project using Next.js and integrated with open AI.
And sometimes issue are occuring.
So I can make thread id, assistant id using open AI key,  and I can send messages to open AI server, but I can't receive response.
So I can send request, but I can't receive response.
How can I fix this issue?
